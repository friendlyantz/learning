# Learning

This is a work in progress of my learning. Some goals achievements and a way to
track that I am actively spending time learning and hopefully improving.

## Current themese

### Data

**Machine Learning**

**Spark**
  - [ ] setup cluster in databricks and code along with example from
    [Spark MLlib 2.0 preview](https://youtu.be/kvk4gnXL9H4). The Notebook
    was originally available at http:/dbricks.co/1UfvAH9 but not there any
    longer. I am sure something like this one
    [Saving & loading ML models](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/438089/notebooks/spark2.0/ML%20persistence%20in%202.0.html)
    via [Spark 2.0 Preview: ML Model
    Persistence](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/05/31/apache-spark-2-0-preview-machine-learning-model-persistence.html)
    or something newer would work well too.
  - [ ] look at zepplin notebooks according to [Intro to ML Spark and Zepplin](https://youtu.be/k4KOmnenuFk)
    following http://tinyurl.com/hwx-intro-to-ml-with-spark
    to get to [Spark tutorials](https://hortonworks.com/apache/spark/#tutorials) and getting started with
    [ML spark and zepplin](https://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/intro-machine-learning-apache-spark-apache-zeppelin/)

  - [ ] [Spark MLlib on Googles Dataproc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgvHDYT_AM)
    running python on googles data lab. A good example to follow along with to start wlth
      - BigQuery on the NYC taxi public data
      - start a cluster
      - random forrest with Map output
      - save model for later use
    probably start here - from links from end of video
