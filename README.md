## Progress

* Wed 15th Feb 2017
  * went to elixir meetup
  * Envato's stools were cool
    Paimio by Artek $350 via http://www.anibou.com.au/
  * Elixir camp Apr 21-24 Mittagong NSW http://elixir.camp/
  * Talk: Monoids in elixir
    * allow for concurrent split and join as order is not important
    * reminds me of talk "Parallel Programming, Fork Join
      - [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRq5UBx6cbA
      - [ ] book "Clojure for the brave and true
      - [ ] braveclojure.com
    * protocols used by Enum and [] square bracket opperator
    * `defprotocol` and `defimpl`
    * monoid shouldn't know about data types
    * example of joining 2 carts with various types
    * could be extended to merge recursively
    * felt that there were a few issues about min/max time and typing that felt
      forced
    * @madlep admitted that this all makes more sense in haskel
    * haskel does type and function inference based on arguments and return
      type.
