# Functinal Programming Patterns

run presentation

    vimdeck talk.md

In an attempt to compare and contrast Object Oriented (OO) and Functional
Programming (FP), a look at OO patterns and their alternatives in FP. This is
also a learning exercise for FP and associated languages. In particular how
ruby compares to functinal languages:
  - Clojure
  - Elixir
  - Scala

Could expand to FP in Javascript?

Initial basing it on examples from (Functional Programming Patterns in Scala
and Clojure)[https://pragprog.com/book/mbfpp/functional-programming-patterns-in-scala-and-clojure[
but also potentially delving into ruby patterns as per Russ Olsen's (Design
Patterns in Ruby)[https://github.com/nslocum/design-patterns-in-ruby]

## Patterns to start on
As these are both in the ruby book and the FP scala/clojure book

  1. Command
    1. Ruby - ch8 getting things done with commands
    1. Scala/Clojure - ch3 replacing Command
  1. Builder
  1. Iterator
  1. Template method
  1. Strategy
  1. Decorator
  1. DSL

## FP patterns in Scala and Clojure

*Replacing OO patterns*

  1. functinal interface
  1. state carrying functial interface
  1. command
  1. builder for immutable objects
  1. iterator
  1. template method
  1. strategy
  1. null object
  1. decorator
  1. visitor
  1. dependency injection

*Functional Patterns*

  1. tail recursion
  1. mutual recursion
  1. filter-map-reduce
  1. chain of operations
  1. function builder
  1. memoization
  1. lazy sequence
  1. focused mutability
  1. customized control flow
  1. domain-specific language

## Design Patterns in Ruby

  1. Template method
  1. Strategy
  1. Observer
  1. Composite
  1. Iterator
  1. Commands
  1. Adapter
  1. Proxy
  1. Decorator
  1. Singlegon
  1. Factory
  1. Builder
  1. Interpreter

  1. DSL
  1. Meta-programming
  1. Convention over configuration
