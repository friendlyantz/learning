# Progress November 2021

* Wed 10th Sep
  - read an encouraging article on Vercel vs Netlify and now there is also
    Cloudflare pages in the mix. Heard about this after Yana Martens Dev Ops
    YouTube live.
    - https://dev.to/maxniederman/netlify-vs-vercel-a-comparison-5643
    - should look into this at some stage - maybe a talk comparing platforms
    - https://vercel.com/
    - https://pages.cloudflare.com/
  - did some timeseries data science learning
  - read some Staff Enginner book
  - still might do some TypeScript
  - maybe get back into Rust tomorrow
  - what about microservices - deploy an app on a serverless infra above
