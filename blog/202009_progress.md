* Tue 15th Sep

Listened to [Tim Ferris (4 hour week) interviewing Patrick Collison
(Stripe)](https://tim.blog/2018/12/24/the-tim-ferriss-show-patrick-collison/)
and particularily took note of
  - having books around the house to read more
  - let books hang around and read them when you are ready (need physical books
    for that)
  - don't read the latest books but let others filter them out
  - seek out to be challenged by other peoples views
  - be willing to understand the position of someone who holds a different view
  - on raising kids, how he was raised and the approach of parents
    - camping holidays
    - lots of freedom
    - allow kids to be part of conversations with interesting house guests
  - a strong sense of trythings out that others may not even be supportive of
  - books to read
    - The dream machine
    - Alan Kay
    - Paul Graham - management vs makers time schedule
in general more reading and more free time
