# RubyConfAU Feb 9-10 2017 

## Overview

- Seems ruby is dying
- People are bringing over techiniques from other languages: concurrency,
  actors, functional programming but ultimately they are better done in
  languages like elixir.
- There is still room for a talk as to why choose ruby and for what problem but
  that didn't happen this time round
- level of talks was dissapointing, very few taught me anything nor inspired me
  to learn anything new.
