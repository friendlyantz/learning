# RubyConfAU Feb 9-10 2017 

## Overview

- Seems ruby is dying
- People are bringing over techiniques from other languages: concurrency,
  actors, functional programming but ultimately they are better done in
  languages like elixir.
- There is still room for a talk as to why choose ruby and for what problem but
  that didn't happen this time round
- level of talks was dissapointing, very few taught me anything nor inspired me
  to learn anything new.

An asside on Aboriginal introduction:
  - very well done
  - interesting around history of William Barak and his image on Melbourne building
  - difficulty in being a half-caste

## Talk by talk
  @timriley
  - ruby faces challenges:
    - elixir, clojure
    - Rust, Go
    - Javascript
  - ruby is comfortable but
    - people have left the community
    - level of complacency
    - we are too focused on rails

    education not success.

  * styles of learning
    - visual/linguistic - read
    - auditory
    - knesthetic - just build it
    - face to face
    - active
  * perception of progress - can help - Sinek videos
  * Grit - self determination
    - dedicate time to keep learning new things
  * risk to be stupid - make mistakes
  * hard(precision playing an instrumet) vs soft skills(interpreting situations)
  * set a goal
  * set deadlines
  * create challenges
  * don't make excuses
  * making something bad is a step closer to making something good
  * small steps - find a learning sweetspot
  * find a mentor
    - who loves teaching
    - short and to the point
  * mistakes & success
    - like retro
    - remember felling of getting it right
  * metrics
  * when stuck shift
  * do things now
  * self study techniques
