  **Property Based Testing**

  - Ruby Theft gem - 0.0.1 not used https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/09/30/quickcheck-in-ruby/
  - article on rantly with good limitations -http://www.troikatech.com/blog/2014/04/02/property-based-testing-in-ruby/
    - shrinking not as good
    - have to write most generators yourself - can lead to bugs
    - no mechanism for stateful code
    - integration with RSpec not that good
    - [ ] could run through the example
    - [ ] makes me think of what would be the advantage of using clojure for
      testing the API? speed and better generators? but even less integration?
      or couldl that work?
