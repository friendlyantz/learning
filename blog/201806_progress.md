    **VI everywhere - what's your super power**
    As a malleable beginner programmer back in the 90's I took some advice to
    set my command line to vi mode set -o vi. As I continued through uni and
    onto my first job I couldn't touch type but when I was on the command line
    I was faster then most - I had a super power, every keystroke had the power
    of vi!

    In this talk I explore

    common patterns for using vi on the command line
    * vi everywhere: in the browser, db console, rails console even as input to
      ruby programs
    * My list of essential vi commands and Equivalents for MAC uSers (yes you
      are using EMACS)
    * Dojo - how to make the most of someone's advice - practice it
