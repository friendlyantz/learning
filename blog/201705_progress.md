  - **Rust resources**
    - https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust
    - https://crates.io/
  - **Study Club**
    - should I learn rust? it goes with node? there is a #rust-lang at work?
    - pairing with juniours article
    - hour of code via https://code.org - ran a session and things resonated from pairing with juniors
    - paired with a 2nd year and had free beer and pizza at clj-melb
    - rails 5
    - closure tables
    - need to focus on practice and not just reading about new things - focus on react
    NOTES to come

* Wed 17th
  - [ ] should I learn **rust?**
    - [ ] [Rust and node when performance matters](https://blog.risingstack.com/how-to-use-rust-with-node-when-performance-matters/)
    - [ ] [Use cases for Neon](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-use-cases-for-Neon-Node-+-Rust) rust and node
    - [ ] [Rust for node devs](http://fredrik.anderzon.se/2016/05/10/rust-for-node-developers-part-1-introduction/)
    - [ ] [Rust lang of future](https://cburgdorf.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/rust-will-be-the-language-of-the-future/)
    - [ ] [Rust Books](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks)
    - [ ] [Rust lang.org](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and on [github rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang/book)

  - [ ] **Redshift?**
    - [ ] [Getting started with Amazon Redshift Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/getting-started-amazon-redshift)
    - [x] [Jupyter Notebooks and Redshift](https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2016/02/08/setting-up-your-analytics-stack-with-jupyter-notebook-aws-redshift/)
      - [ ] follow along

  - [ ] take a look at [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus)

  * read artice [Pairing with junior developers](https://www.devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers/)
  mostly things I know and have thought about in the past. The key is let them
  type. I also like the let them make mistakes and find things to have in
  common, what they can teach you, what are they good at.

  - [ ] interesting looking at closure trees
    * https://github.com/mceachen/closure_tree
    * https://blog.openshift.com/tmp-part-2-using-clojure-tree-with-activerecord/
    * https://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data
  - [ ] would be interesting to build closure tree in rails/dry-rb/react as a
    tree creator and drag and drop component
  - [ ] would be interesting to build a nested key-value store with deep
    updates, drag and drop re-ordering using rails and react
    - or using dry-rb?

  **Dry RB**
    - [ ] http://dry-rb.org/news/2016/08/15/introducing-dry-system/
    - [ ] http://dry-rb.org/
    - [ ] [dry-web-roda](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-web-roda)

  * went home and paired instead
  Study club
  * **Fast.ai**
    * need 'iterative deepening' (is that a term) to go back to restudy certain parts of the video
    * ended writing down time codes to find the key parts of the video
    * someone wrote down time codes in the learning wiki but they are not the same things I wanted to review
    * Beware that the course can be rough around the edges and links change but nothing in the documents tells you about it
    * **Hidden AWS costs**
      * IP and volume are charged (can cost as much as $20/month) even if they are stopped (but not released/deleted)
    * Still looking at setting up GPU on mac
  * **MelbURN - R user meetup**
    * More of a Microsoft pitch then about Galaxy classification

  * **Books**
    * Ben Horowitz, The hard things about hard things
    * Peter Thiel - From zero to one
      * as a startup avoid competition become a monopoly then you will have
        time to develop something for your customers rather then always being
        busy competing. Remember that the landscape will change and in good
        time your monopoly will be over, the world is not static
  * **Category Theory**
    * via [HN link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14138196)
