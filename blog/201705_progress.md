  Run through logistic regression in spark Ch 8.2 SIA and use it to submit an entry in kaggle competition
  Kaggle next steps:
    - [ ] output from first logistic regression (likely indicator drugs)
      - [ ] use predictions
      - [ ] in scala [sum output](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37032025/how-to-sum-the-values-of-one-column-of-a-dataframe-in-spark-scala)
      - [ ] [sum of row values](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36360540/spark-sum-of-row-values)
    - [ ] write it up
    ...
    - [ ] get data straight from BigQuery [BigQuery Connector](https://cloud.google.com/hadoop/examples/bigquery-connector-spark-example)
    - [ ] get my head around more scala/spark
      - [ ] [reshaping data with pivot in Spark](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/02/09/reshaping-data-with-pivot-in-apache-spark.html)
      - [ ] read this git book https://www.gitbook.com/book/jaceklaskowski/mastering-apache-spark/details
      - [ ] [joins](http://kirillpavlov.com/blog/2016/04/23/beyond-traditional-join-with-apache-spark/)
    - [ ] other classification problem examples
      - [ ] [Breast Cancer](https://mapr.com/blog/predicting-breast-cancer-using-apache-spark-machine-learning-logistic-regression/)
      - [ ] [predictive analysis on food inspection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-machine-learning-mllib-ipython)
    ...
    - [ ] run in python
    - [ ] run in Google's data proc? when would this be necessary
    ...
    - [ ] follow on from logistic regression in particular [Spark docs ML classification regression](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-classification-regression.html)
      - [ ] review logistic regression
      - [ ] [Decission Tree classifier](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-classification-regression.html#decision-tree-classifier)
      - [ ] [Random forrest classifier](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-classification-regression.html#random-forest-classifier)
      - [ ] as well as Gradient Boost Classifier and more
    - [ ] consider other algorithms [Spark examples ML](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/ml)
    ...
    - [ ] build a pipeline?
      - [ ] [Spark MLlib via python](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2016/21D_Spark_MLib.html)
      - [ ] [deploy realtime app](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-deployed-my-spark-document-classification-logistic-regression-model-s-as-a-standalone-app-64b05b44e102)
    ...
    - [ ] greater depth
      - [ ] anything from MLlib? [MLlib linear methods](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/mllib-linear-methods.html)
      - [ ] [migration to ML from MLlib](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html)
      - [ ] [SQL prog guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html)
      - [ ] [ML features](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-features.html)
    - [ ] other examples [record linking ML and GraphX](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/record-linking-with-apache-sparks-mllib-graphx-d118c5f31f83)

* Sat 6th
  Logistic Regression Ch 8.2 SIA and getting head around some spark

* Fri 5th
  Watched presentations in MelbDatathon2015
  1. Depression related stats and how pharmacies can help augment treatment
  1. Dangerous drug combinations

* Thu 4th
  kaggle next steps
    My plan for the kaggle:
    - [ ] identify test set in our data (who has started using diabetes medication)
    - [ ] follow this example https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/time-series-forecasting-codes-python/
    - [ ] follow similar example in Tensor Flow book (ch10)
    - [ ] attempt to apply to our problem
    - [ ] look at binary classification
      - [ ] Deep learning Python book 3.6
      - [ ] Tensor Flow book Ch 4
    - [ ] look at Sparkâ€™s MLlib
    - [ ] tweak all the things

      * Start on your deliverable right away and iterate
        _we had 3 weeks to produce report but only started producing it in the
        last 3 hours_
      * Do the riskiest activities first
        _for us this was ML and we opted for safer micro analysis with manual
        queries till the last minute_
      * Motivate each other
      * communicate with deliverables - git repo commits and some gchat
    **Neuralink**
      * Go read about it on http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html
