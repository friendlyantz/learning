        "Realm of Racket" although a games programming book very enjoyable
    Hugh Middleton
      * Still in R refresher about to get stuck into ML in about 4 hours
        * Michael Milewski highly recommends watching the 30min starting video
          from http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html to get into ML
          programming without the refresher
    Michael Milewski
      * Consolidating my learnings from recent hackathon in jupyter notebooks

      * Why do people webinar? discussion of why you would choose a webinar
        over a video, a white-paper/blog post, a book/tutorial, a conference?
        do some companies treat this as some tax break differently from other
          learning?

      check against other users
    * not convinced about their idea of sophisticated fraud rings yet also
      starting with $2 test transactions in person not online
    * large adoption in banks and government
    * Should look at this as a recommendation engine for connected artists.
    * also
      * neo4jsandbox.com to play

  * how to spark innovation - a series of questions?
    * [7 tips for generating new ideas](https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/business-strategy-planning/innovate/pages/7-ways-generate-innovative-new-ideas.aspx)
      break down industry into components - attribute listing (proces, price,
      artists, etc) - ask questions about each attribute, cluster common areas
      Achieveable innovation is a sideways step rather than revolutionary
      upheaval. use **SCAMPER** to generate ideas

        1. Substitue something
        1. Combine it with something else
        1. Adapt something to it
        1. Modify or magnify it
        1. Put it to some other use
        1. Eliminate something
        1. Reverse or rearrange it

    * [7 strategies for generating ideas](http://www.innovationresource.com/innovation-speaker-resources/seven-strategies-for-generating-ideas/)
      * Ideas cannot be forced but organisations can still rethink the way
        ideas happen.
      * Be more involving of whole organisation, customers, suppliers, etc
      * Organisations have I-mentors to foster ideation techniques across company
      - [ ] Put forward a problem/challenge to be solved

    * [7 Ways to Generate Great Ideas](http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/7-ways-to-generate-great-ideas.html)
      * from Dr. Blaine McCormick 10 minutes timed to come up with 42 ideas on
        a specific problem or topic

    * [Thinking Inside the Box: 5 Ways to Generate Breakthrough Ideas](http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/thinking-inside-the-box-5-ways-to-generate-breakthrough-ideas)
      Systematic Initiative Thinking SIT
      1. Subtraction - remove recording to make a walkman
      1. Task unification - backpack straps that also massage the wearer
      1. Multiplication - component copied or changed - camera flash used for
         redeye reduction
      1. Division - component used elsewhere - oven changed into warming draw
      1. Attribute Dependency - 2 product attributes that correlate -
         transition sunglasses change when in sun
      Start with a conceptual solution and work back to a problem

    * [Build innovation engine in 90 days](https://hbr.org/2014/12/build-an-innovation-engine-in-90-days)
      Minimal Viable Innovation System - maybe next step to bring ideas to life
      in an organisation

    * also remember
      * use post it notes
      * go outside
      * listen to music or do sport
      * give people a platform to hack on - boom could be just this
      * look at what's bugging you
      * what are you driven to solve
      * mix up recent startups, tech libs or things you read on HN

  * read ch 1 DL with python a good history - again a new wave of innovation of
    sorts that i seem to have missed but was somewhat concious of happening
    - Keras for DL - perceptual problems
    - XGB Gradient boosting machine - for structured data
    also look at CUDA GPU interface, Google's TPU specific for tensor
    processing, Decision trees and Random forrests

    * Me - Readme docs are hard
      * Played with react-universally (as used in boom) but struggled with
        instructions like "You need to add your own version of Weather Icons
        CSS." from react-weathericons made me think: how? where? from where?
        what syntax? how to incorporate in react? in webpack? give me
        something!!!
      * OptaPlanner is a constraint satisfaction solver to solve
        things like bin packing, travelling salesman, rostering etc. Running a
        demo is easy but getting a simple program written from scratch is
        impossible solving shortest path with a number of trucks and constraints on when customers accept deliveries
        * uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search under the covers
        * blog how to win the US election with less then a quarter of the vote
        * some insight on running/starting an open source project https://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2016/08/07/ADecadeOfOptaPlanner.html
      * Book Review Machine Learning with TensorFlow easy to follow along with and a lightweight approach but unfortunately no meaty examples to really solve a problem. More of a backgrounder and reminded me that python is a language that is very much alive.
      * playing with HAWK use python httpie
        pip install requests-hawk httpie

* Wed 8th
  * TensorFlow book: linear regression, multi classifiers, k-means and audio
    segmentation example, Hidden Markov Models, autoencoders for images
    * starting to feel that the examples may get you started but will not solve
      a real world problem at the level of the book, maybe in a later chapter?
* Tue 7th
  * Redux wired up in data-fe
  * charting libs Plotly and SigmaJS added to data-fe
* Mon 6th
  * added api to data-fe
* Sun 5th
  * spark-jobserver attempt to run

  * building out Front end for React to display data components for upcoming
    unearthed hackathon, [Data FE](https://github.com/saramic/data-fe)

    following https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally/blob/master/docs/FEATURE_BRANCHES.md
    git clone https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally my-project
    cd my-project
    git remote rename origin upstream
    git remote add origin https://github.com/my-github-username/my-project
    git push -u origin master

    looked at adding simple charts http://www.reactd3.org/ still a work in progress

  * read summaries of GraphX in Action
    * start with Spark Job Server to get simple REST API endpoint up
    * probably do the hard work of working through most of the algorithms and
      the kind of problems they solve
    * look at Zepplin and D3.js for simple visualisation
    * look into state of GraphFrames as they are faster
  * read summaries of TensorFlow in Action books
    * probably need to work through most of this linearly although Ch9 is
      around image classification
    * probably look at the default problems on the website

* Fri 3rd
  * coding dojo ruby - Roman to arabic converter
* Thu 2nd
  * **NOTHING**
  * Study club at work
    * Adam on building his distributed merge sort in elixir
      * [Enum.sort](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html) eager
      * [Stream.sort](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html) lazy
      * [Flow](https://hexdocs.pm/flow/Flow.html) parallel
      * deterministic sort on objects
      ```ruby
        ary = [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 1, b: 1}, {a: 2, b: 1}]
        ary.sort_by{|t| [t[:a], t[:b]]}
        => [{:a=>1, :b=>1}, {:a=>1, :b=>2}, {:a=>2, :b=>1}]
      ```
      Adam is working on a distributed flow merge
      this reminded me of the talk [Parallel Programming, Fork Join, and
      Reducers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRq5UBx6cbA) by Daniel
      Higginbotham about I think something similar
    * Kirsten talked about here involvment in
      [coderdojo](https://coderdojo.com/) and
      [coderdojo_Melb](https://coderdojomelbourne.com.au/) where she helps kids
      8 - 17 years how to program. Currently every 2nd Thursday in Carlton
      library. Great initiative and great way to become a mentor of sorts.
    * I mentioned learning styles from
      [Mastery](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81940.Mastery) by George
      Leonard and the reality of needing to enjoy the plateau as you are going
      to sit there for a long time. I also mentioned my current investigations
      into why MD5 calculations vary so much between my
      perl/ruby/elixir/clojure implementations.
      Adam mentioned that elixir/erlang are known not to be the best for
      numerical speed more for consistency, as mentioned in
      [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1308527/when-does-erlangs-parallelism-overcome-its-weaknesses-in-numeric-computing)
