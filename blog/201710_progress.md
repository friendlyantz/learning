    since playing the [Human Resource
    Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) game with my
    son, was thinking what could be a logical next step in learning. I would
    presume it would be Assembler, then C and then move into something higher
    order like Haskel. looking on the web for assembler I found the following:
    - [ ] [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) similar but more formal looking game
